/*
* Write a function that generates every sequence of throws a single
* player could throw over a three-round game of rock-paper-scissors.
*
* Your output should look something like:
*   ["RRR",
*    "RRP",
*    "RRS",
*    "RPR",
*    ...etc...
*   ]
*
* Extra credit:
*   - Make your function return answers for any number of rounds.
*
* Example:
* rockPaperScissors(5); // => ['RRRRR', 'RRRRP', 'RRRRS', etc...]
*
*/

var rockPaperScissors = function (rounds) {
  var moveSet = ['R', 'P', 'S'];
  // could we iterate across the array and push the move into the current rounds array
  // only if that move doesnt exist at that round index?
  return [];
};
